# Bike Stores Data Analysis
Retail data holds powerful clues about business growth. By analyzing sales, productions, staff performance, and customers behavior from bike stores, this project uncovers actionable insights to support smarter decisions in marketing, expansion, and product strategy.

**Disclaimer**: this analysis is still at a **basic level** and may contain errors or inaccuracies. So, further validation are recommended.

## Dataset
**Bike Stores Dataset**

This is a sample database from [www.sqlservertutorial.net](https://www.sqlservertutorial.net/wp-content/uploads/SQL-Server-Sample-Database.zip) for a retail bike store.

The sample database is copyrighted and cannot be used for commercial purposes. For example, it cannot be used for the following but is not limited to the purposes:
- Selling
- Including in paid courses

This dataset consists of these tables:
- brands: the brand’s information of bikes such as brand_id and brand_name.
- categories: the bike’s categories such as category_id and category_name.
- customers: the customer’s information including first name, last name, phone, email, street, city, state and zip code.
- order_items: the line items of a sales order. Each line item belongs to a sales order specified by the order_id column. A sales order line item includes product, order quantity, list price, and discount.
- orders: the sales order’s header information including customer, order status, order date, required date, shipped date. It also stores the information on where the sales transaction was created (store) and who created it (staff). Each sales order has a row in the sales_orders table. A sales order has one or many line items stored in the order_items table.
- products: the product’s information such as name, brand, category, model year, and list price. Each product belongs to a brand specified by the brand_id column. Hence, a brand may have zero or many products. Each product also belongs a category specified by the category_id column. Also, each category may have zero or many products.
- staffs: the essential information of staffs including first name, last name, email, and phone. A staff works at a store specified by the value in the store_id column. A store can have one or more staffs. A staff reports to a store manager specified by the value in the manager_id column. If the value in the manager_id is null, then the staff is the top manager.
- stocks: the inventory information i.e. the quantity of a particular product in a specific store.
- stores: the store’s information. Each store has a store name, contact information such as phone and email, and an address including street, city, state, and zip code.

If a staff no longer works for any stores, the value in the active column is set to zero.

## Setup
### Schema Diagram
The schema diagram used in this project can be viewed at the following link [here](https://www.sqlservertutorial.net/wp-content/uploads/SQL-Server-Sample-Database.png). In this project, the dataset is splitted into two schemes, sales and productions.

### Create Database
```sql
CREATE DATABASE BikeStores;
USE BikeStores;
```
### Create and Load Database
In this project, SQL queries are executed using Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio Version 21. The database tables are created and loaded by running the SQL files provided from [www.sqlservertutorial.net](https://www.sqlservertutorial.net/wp-content/uploads/SQL-Server-Sample-Database.zip).
